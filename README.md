# Customer Segmentation
Customer segmentation using K-Means clustering to identify distinct groups based on demographics and spending behavior.

## Objective
To segment mall customers into distinct groups based on their demographic and behavioral attributes (such as age, income, and spending score), using clustering techniques. These customer segments can help the mall management design targeted marketing strategies, personalized services, and improve overall customer satisfaction and profitability.

### Benefits
- Identify high-spending customers vs. budget-conscious ones.

- Understand the age-income-spending patterns of different customer groups.

- Enable personalized marketing campaigns based on segment behavior.

- Optimize resource allocation (e.g., premium services for high-value clusters).

- Aid in business decision-making for store layout, offers, and promotions.
